[Audio] Interview Nicolás – Andrés

[Nicolás] Okay, ready, now yes, now yes. One, two, three. Well, good morning, my name is Nicolás Belén and I am here with the student Andrés Ocampo Porras. Nice to meet you, Andrés.  
[Andrés] Hi Nicolás, nice to meet you.  
[Nicolás] Very well, Andrés, so, let me tell you. Together with my team we are doing research on how students handle the materials, tools, and other resources they use both inside the university and in their life as university students in general. Keep in mind there will be no right or wrong answers; we just want to understand what your experiences with this topic have been. So, would it be okay if we record the conversation so I can take notes later?  
[Andrés] Of course, you have my full authorization.  
[Nicolás] Great, perfect, Andrés. So, to start, tell me a bit about yourself: what semester are you in, what are you currently studying, in which program?  
[Andrés] Of course. I study Law, I’m in my fourth semester of Law. However, I’m also doing a double degree with Music, a double program with Music, and I’m doing a minor in German Language and Culture. Those are kind of the things I do at the university.  
[Nicolás] Okay, very interesting, Andrés. From what I see, you have a very diverse profile across different disciplines. Taking that into account, could you tell me, in general, in your different areas, what types of physical materials or resources you use in your different courses?  
[Andrés] Of course, I’d be happy to. Well, in Law, honestly, even though everything is always digital and we are in a digital era, they still require us a lot to have physical codes. That is, even though they always upload the readings on Bloque Neón and things like that, it is very important that in class you have the code, either updated or recent, but a code that works for the class. So, in Labor Law we use the Labor Code, in Contracts we use the Civil Code, etc. So, on the Law side, I think one of the most important tools I use are the codes, the books we are always requesting from the library, that we borrow from family, friends, and so on.  

In Music, I’ve noticed that we use headphones a lot, above all. In Music, generally, at least in my area, where I’m in the Music Production concentration, they always require you to have headphones because everyone has their own computer. So, headphones and hard drives. I think those are the two most important elements in the musical area. Obviously, without going into people who play instruments and so on, because they don’t necessarily need something they use every day beyond the instrument. So, that’s the idea there.  

And then in German, I can’t really tell you that much. In German, of course, the books we use—it’s the same book, at least at the university; it’s a book called “Panorama.” So, at least in languages, I know that the book…  
[Nicolás] Andrés, sorry, we can’t hear you.  
[Andrés] That book that is used at the university is repeated the whole time across three semesters.  
[Nicolás] Ah, okay, got it.  
[Andrés] Hello, can you hear me?  
[Nicolás] Yes, yes, there was a small cut, sorry, go on.  
[Andrés] Sorry. Okay, I’ll continue. So, in German, at least, it’s those books that are always used for the level. I think they’re always reused because it’s the same book; they teach all the levels with it. So that’s like a general perspective of my three disciplines in terms of the things I use the most.  
[Nicolás] Okay, perfect. I’d like to go back to a small point you mentioned. You said that on the Law side, as an example, each course can tend to have its different codes or reading resources that vary depending on the subject. Is that correct?  
[Andrés] That is totally correct, that’s how it is.  
[Nicolás] Okay. For my part, to summarize, since of course courses vary with different semesters, has it gotten to the point where you have some type of material or resource that tends to accumulate or that you keep from each semester you take?  
[Andrés] Hmm, well, if I’m very honest, in the Law area at least, I could tell you that something that does pile up is the readings. That is, even if they’re digital, to try to give you a concrete answer, I think something that really fills up my space is all the readings they upload for me. So that is really something that just piles up.  

But for now, I mean, if I mention codes to you, they don’t necessarily stay there because I’m going to reuse them in another course that covers the same topic, the same branch of Law, but I could try to answer your question by saying that, well, the books do pile up. That is, once the course ends, the code stays there until I take that subject again, and as I go through more semesters, I have more codes. So if we talk in general terms—not the same code, but in general—codes do pile up, books pile up, but that would be in a general sense.  
[Nicolás] Okay, perfect. And well, now let’s look at the other side of the coin. Have you ever had not so much an accumulation but a need for resources—some item, equipment, something that you needed that was hard for you to get?  
[Andrés] Yes. Yes, but I would have to answer that from the Music side. I think that’s where I’ve felt it the most… if that’s okay with you.  
[Nicolás] Okay.  
[Andrés] Are you okay with that?  
[Nicolás] Yes, no problem.  
[Andrés] Great, perfect. So, what happens? At least in the Music area, as I was telling you, at least in the Music Production concentration or anything that involves using a computer in Music, you absolutely need to have access to the software, you absolutely need to have good headphones, you absolutely need to have a good hard drive.  

I think that’s where I’ve felt the need the most, because these are expensive products. That is, you have to invest a lot of financial resources to have a decent experience that aligns with the right you truly have to an education. In other words, to be able to get a good education in Music Production, at least, you need to have the software, the computer—things that, thanks to my privilege, I’ve been able to get, not easily, but I’ve managed to, in order to keep up with the course.  

However, to try to give you a more linear and coherent answer with what we’ve been discussing about Law, I do think it is very true that each semester, given the diversity of books and codes that exist, it’s not like I can tell you “there’s only the Constitution”; there’s the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, the General Procedure Code, the Labor Code. Those are things I need, and every semester that I start a new course—since I’m now in fourth semester, this has already happened to me across these four semesters—it has happened that every semester I need that book, I need the code; if not, I can’t study.  

So that’s how I’d answer that question, I think. I don’t know what you think.  
[Nicolás] Great, thank you for sharing that experience with us, Andrés. Very good, now I’d like to move to a more personal side, about your experience with managing these materials: how you’ve obtained them, transported them, managed them. So I’d like… you mentioned earlier, for example, on the Music side, that it was very complicated to, for example, obtain the equipment, the headphones.  
[Andrés] Yes.  
[Nicolás] Could you, from that or another experience, or maybe an experience of a classmate in your courses, tell me how that experience of getting that resource was, whether new or used? How was it?  
[Andrés] Of course. In fact, I’m glad you’re asking because that was exactly something I wanted to mention. In Music especially—as I said before—I had the privilege of getting the headphones I needed, the Mac, which is, well, an Apple computer, right?  
[Nicolás] Mhm.  
[Andrés] The Mac I needed… all those things are very expensive, especially because the engineering they require has to be advanced in order for you to be able to hear, I don’t know, for example the “sparkle” in the music, which is what it’s called.  
[Nicolás] Mhm.  
[Andrés] So, it was hard to get them, of course, because at first I didn’t have the money. I had to, let’s say, in many cases pay in installments or find ways to get the money.  

But I can tell you that at least several classmates of mine didn’t even have access to the headphones I somehow managed to get, and they weren’t even using, for example, the ones I use, which are Audio-Technica that cost more than 600,000 pesos; they only used wired ones that cost 20,000. So I can tell you that from that experience I realized that, of course, it is hard to get and keep up, especially in that learning process, because if you use wired headphones that don’t have the sparkle or the equalization you need, obviously you fall behind.  

So I think, in that sense, at least in Music, it’s a spectrum. That is, it’s a spectrum of different product ranges, like product tiers you need depending on your purchasing power, you know? I mean, if you can get the high-end product, great; but if you have to go with the low-end, you go with the low-end. You can study with the low-end gear, for sure; is it the best experience? No.  

And on the other hand, I’d also like to mention, if you’ll allow me…  
[Nicolás] Mhm.  
[Andrés] I’d like to mention, especially, what happens in Law—now changing the subject a bit, sorry. In Law, I also think it’s very important—and see how interesting this is—that it’s very much based on need. For example, in Music it’s very necessary to have the best, the newest, something that isn’t damaged, as you mentioned.  
[Nicolás] Mhm.  
[Andrés] However, in Law that’s not the case. In Law, in general, it’s: if the code is there in print, it’s fine. If it’s used, it’s fine; if it’s all highlighted, I don’t care, it’s fine. So I think that shows—though I don’t know in what framework you might use that answer—but I also see it from that perspective of need. At least in Law, expectations for what you can get in terms of learning outcomes drop a lot; and that’s not the same as what happens in Music.  

So I don’t know how we could delve further into this, but that would be my specific answer to the question you’re asking.  
[Nicolás] And I appreciate that, Andrés, because you actually bring up an aspect I’d like to dig into, which is this idea of prioritizing new products over used products. Obviously one would assume—I’m sharing my opinion here—that used products, given the wear, the use, will tend to be cheaper, right?  
[Andrés] Of course.  
[Nicolás] And they can be an affordable option. However, from your point of view: have you ever, I don’t know, tried to find or get a resource from another student as an alternative? Specifically, during the process where you tried to get your headphones or when you were trying to get the codes in Law, have you ever intended to look for materials from another student?  
[Andrés] Absolutely. In fact, what you mention seems very relevant because that was my first step. Before I was able to get new headphones, before I could get the codes bought at the bookstore or donated by friends, it’s true that at the beginning, when I didn’t have the resources, I had to borrow a lot of things. Let me give you examples.  

In Law, well, those who did have a Civil Code for the exam or for class—because participation was required, memorizing the rules, etc., things you can infer—I had to borrow from my friends who were in another section, in another section that would allow me, obviously, not to hold them back and for me to be able to use those resources.  

But in Music especially, I think it’s also very important to understand that, as you can see, it’s not just the physical items like headphones, staff paper, etc., the computer, but also the digital software. For example, in Production we use a program called Pro Tools, which works with licenses you pay for and renew monthly.  

What happened? Since I didn’t have Pro Tools, because it’s expensive—in fact, to this day I still don’t have Pro Tools; I can’t study with Pro Tools unless it’s the free version—in order to do the assignments outside of what the university provided me—which, of course, I won’t deny, they did provide some spaces, somewhat limited, with computers and software licenses—it is true that, to be able to submit a good assignment, I had to spend time outside the university.  

So obviously my first thought was: okay, which friends of mine have a good computer with Pro Tools? And that’s how I did several assignments with people who lent me their account, with people who lent me their computer. So I think that’s kind of how it goes, Nicolás.  
[Nicolás] Okay, very good, Andrés. So, as you mentioned, you’re currently more oriented towards close circles, classmates you feel more secure with. However, I want to bring this up again. Going back to your example about the headphones, in the end you decided to buy a new product, right? Would you say what was the final reason for you to decide “I’m going that way”? Or did you never have the chance to consider that product used, or was it always your priority to get them new?  
[Andrés] Well, although I understand your question, I do have to be realistic here, and it’s that, at least in the case of headphones, it’s not just a precision level that made me need them to be new—in other words, freshly opened, if you know what I mean—it was also kind of an issue of hygiene.  

So, honestly, I didn’t initially think, “Okay, I’ll get used headphones.” However, it’s also true that I didn’t find that option available… I don’t know if my perspective is a bit narrow, but I also don’t know the tools to look for something outside my close circle, like social media.  

I honestly don’t use those things to find products, but that’s a personal thing. However, I can infer that, of course, it would have been very valuable if I had known, I don’t know, a person on Instagram who had posted “Hey, I’ve got these Audio-Technica headphones I used for six months.” Well, maybe I would have considered that option, but that option never really came up.  

Since those options never appeared, maybe I didn’t take that path. But if they had appeared more easily, of course I probably would’ve thought twice before making a decision.  
[Nicolás] Very good, Andrés. So, to wrap up this part of our interview, I’d like to know, on your side: as you said, you tried to find resources, whether from other students or new. However, tell me, since you also mentioned that you’ve accumulated things, have you, on the other hand, tried to sell, offer, or in the end share some of the resources from past semesters or that you no longer use?  
[Andrés] I can tell you that honestly, yes. At least in Law, many of my codes that I’ve already gotten, whether because I bought them or because they were given to me, it’s true that, at least when I hear another student in need, I lend them. That is, something I try to do is lend them out.  

I don’t really like to part with them, not because I don’t want to, but because I still need them. So, since getting rid of them doesn’t bring any benefit to me—because I’m still studying, I still need the codes—of course I try to lend them whenever I can.  

On the Music side it’s a bit different because, as I told you, you need the items to start studying. From the second or third day, all the students—whether low-end, mid-range, or high-end—already have their items. Because whoever falls behind in that sense in Music isn’t really able to catch up later; it’s very difficult because it involves practice, it’s a discipline.  

So what happens is that, in that sense, I haven’t really had the chance to be able to say, “Hey, do you need headphones? Hey, need an account? Hey, need a computer?” But it is true that I’m willing to lend things, though that service you mention of selling, at least for me, hasn’t really occurred to me, but as I said, that’s because I still need the items. But I would definitely consider it, I don’t know, once I finish my degree. Of course, maybe if someone needs, I don’t know, the Civil Code, the Labor Code, I’ll surely give them away.  
[Nicolás] Okay, very good, Andrés. So, if I understand correctly, right now you’d consider yourself more a buyer than a seller in this kind of relationship I’m describing, right?  
[Andrés] Yes, of course. That’s exactly how I want to put it. Personally, I think it’s not so much free will per se, but that I’ve tended to seek quality or precision. Like what a code can offer you: even if it’s highlighted, it’s precise, it’s there. So, in terms of the exactness of what they ask from me, what I need, I buy it or get it in a way that makes it easy for me to study.  

So it’s like the ease that precision gives me, if that makes sense.  
[Nicolás] Great, perfect. Now that you’ve clarified that, I’d like to go a bit deeper into this buyer profile. So, you told me you’ve looked in different places or, well, tried to look for your tools in different ways. However, as you said, they didn’t appear directly.  

Starting from that idea that they didn’t show up on social media or other channels, tell me: what was your first step to look for those resources? What were your first options—websites, stores, etc.?  
[Andrés] Of course, Nicolás. Let me begin by saying that I think, in both cases, across both degrees, what has happened is that there is a scarcity of those tools. And maybe it’s not a material scarcity in the sense that they can’t be bought or found easily, but that the opportunity hasn’t been there.  

As I said, they’re not being offered. I mean, if I look for that on the internet, I’m going to find something to buy. I need to have a very large amount of contacts to be able to get something that really works for me. So, sorry, I have to ask because I didn’t understand the second part of your question very well. Could you repeat the question so I can condense my answer?  
[Nicolás] Yes. Basically, during your search process for these materials, what were your first options for searching?  
[Andrés] Right.  
[Nicolás] Where did you direct your attention primarily?  
[Andrés] Okay. So, as I was saying before, my first idea was to search for them on the internet. That is, if the best option for me—what I consider to be the best option—is to buy. Not necessarily “spend money,” that’s not the same; it’s to buy. If the best option is to have it new, it’s being able to use it in the best possible way.  

So, of course, the first thing I think is “buy.” When I think about buying, I compare prices already with more affordable ranges for me. That is, if this is what it costs, can I get it for less, with a discount, promotion, whatever. But my first step is always to look up the price online—that is, how much that thing costs online, if I can get it better.  

If it’s very expensive and I can’t afford it—like with the software I mentioned—I still don’t have the software to this day and I’m okay with the free version, as long as it has the features I need. So I think that would be the first step, to be very honest.  
[Nicolás] Okay, perfect. And going back to the idea, you said “buy it new,” but, while going back to the idea of used items that you mentioned—on Instagram, social media—are you aware of any other channel or other formal or informal, virtual or in-person means where you also could have gotten, or where you know people have gotten, resources like the ones you mentioned?  
[Andrés] Well, now that you ask that, I just remembered something that I did see happening, especially with professors. That is, I think something I had sort of overlooked is that professors also give tips in that sense.  

I remember that my professor in the Production class I took would say, “If someone needs help with information about cheap headphones, I know a person.” I think that is directly a channel—not exactly everyday, but it is a channel I identified to answer you.  

On the other hand, of course, another step is: “Hey, where did you buy your headphones? Where did you buy your stuff? Where did you get them?” Asking my classmates, I think that’s also important, because they’re the ones who are up to date with these things.  

And, of course, when I talk about social media, what I mean is you look up, I don’t know, Mercado Libre, you know? That can also be interesting for finding things. Instagram: I know there are accounts of people who share all that, but I don’t follow them.  

But to give you a concise answer, I’ve identified those channels. I think that’s my visual spectrum, so to speak; that’s what I can identify at a glance.  
[Nicolás] Okay, perfect. And just to close this chapter, I’d like to know: as you said, you know those channels. However, from what I understand, you didn’t really want to dig much into them, right?  
[Andrés] That’s true.  
[Nicolás] So, with that in mind, what do you think were the obstacles or factors that didn’t motivate you or that kept you away from using those channels? In other words, what kept you from, for instance, preferring them instead of going straight to the internet to look for a new option?  
[Andrés] Directly, yes, of course. Well, look, I think it’s what I said in previous questions you asked me—it’s this issue of functionality. That is, I know that “used,” for me… I’d first have to explain how I feel about it to give you an honest opinion.  

“Used” for me means not only affordable, cheap, maybe easy, but it also sounds like it might have a flaw, it might have something that leads me to lose more than what I’m investing. And that would be an obstacle, whether mental, or due to values or principles, etc.  

I think that’s something that stops me from thinking right away, “Ah, used is what I’m going to buy.” However, other obstacles, I think, are what I mentioned before: it’s not normal; it’s not normal for me to know places where you can, just like that, in a forum, share opinions about products.  

I mean, for me that’s not easy on a small scale, in a close university environment like Universidad de los Andes. We could talk about Reddit, but Twitter and so on is already taking it to an extreme, you know? But at least in a close environment, I think that also pushes me away because it makes me feel distant from that; it makes me feel like an outsider, because I don’t really know the people who would lend me something, I don’t really know if they want to rob me or not, if they want to take advantage in some way, as anyone could.  

So, because of that, for convenience, I’d much rather buy the product. But it’s also true that sometimes the product, item, etc., ends up being more expensive than my preferences can allow. And of course that’s where we talk about taking risks, and those risks are the obstacles I just mentioned, which could be psychological, cultural, or we could also talk about simple physical obstacles.  

Like, what obstacles? Well, the assignment is due tomorrow and if I don’t get headphones now… you know what I mean? So I think time is especially important here because, as I said, in Music—from my experience—I’ve realized that, one way or another, people get the things.  

If a class starts and you need headphones, everyone brings something out—AirPods, wired headphones, call-center-style headsets with just one ear—those kinds of things. That’s what I mean: people pull out the resources, but because of time pressure.  

So I think that can also be seen as an obstacle to making a quick decision that isn’t really thought through—and when you do think it through, that’s when you can make a proper choice like: “Okay, these are used headphones, but let’s examine where they come from, how, how much they cost,” you know?  
[Nicolás] I see, Andrés. So, with all that you’re telling me, we could say that the main challenge, the wall that currently keeps you from buying used products is, on one hand, the distrust you feel towards sellers. Obviously those marketplaces, as you describe them, may have less quality control or fewer constraints than the original store. Besides what you said, all the time it takes to verify the seller, get to know them, takes a lot of time, and you, as you say, need a lot of immediacy.  

So, in summary, is the insecurity you feel about buying used products from these people and the time it takes to verify those sellers the two main pillars that make it harder to buy used products, at least in this university context? Is that correct?  
[Andrés] That’s totally correct, and if you allow me to extend just a bit, I’d like to address that—thank you. It’s true, I don’t think you could have said it better: it’s a lack of trust. And that distrust comes from the precision, as I said, of the items they’re offering me.  

However, I should make an important clarification, based on my experience in both degrees: that doesn’t happen in Law. At least, not with books. You know that a book, even if it’s used, you pretty much know it’s going to be fine; it’s a book. You’re not going to think a page is missing; those, at least, cultural assumptions, that trust, isn’t in question there.  

If it’s a cheap code, man, I’m going to buy it. But if we’re talking about technical equipment that requires precision—like we could compare to other majors, like computers for Systems Engineering or laptops—it’s not the same as when someone needs a ruler, a set square for a math class. They’re not going to doubt if it’s broken or not; you know that if someone sells a ruler, it’s a ruler.  

So I think that clarification is important to give weight to the answer I’m giving you in the way you’re asking. I think that precision point is important.  
[Nicolás] Perfect, Andrés. Let me say that I really appreciate you sharing your experiences—how your process has been as a buyer and even, in some sense, as a seller.  

So, if you want, to close: do you think what you’ve just mentioned could also be experienced by other classmates, not only in Music or Law, but generally across the university? Or is it more personal? How do you see it?  
[Andrés] Absolutely. I think you just said it, and that’s my position, and I stand firmly by it. I think this can be applied to all degrees. There are degrees where you need things that are more practical, easy to get, just as there are degrees that require much more technicity that can kind of match what the university needs to provide a good education.  

So, to wrap up, I don’t think I’ll go deeper into it because I think I’ve said enough about what I think and what I feel, but I want to thank you and your team for getting into this topic. I think it’s very important and really cool that you can dig deeper into these practices—university, students, university, equipment. I think it’s cool. So, thank you very much for your time, Nicolás.  
[Nicolás] No, my pleasure, Andrés. So, with that said, we’ll end the interview here, Andrés. It was a pleasure talking with you, and I hope you have the best experiences going forward at the university.  
[Andrés] Likewise, Nicolás, thank you.
